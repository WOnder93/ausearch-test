This includes a couple programs that exercise ausearch for testing purposes. This is a short explaination of the files included.

gather-logs is a script that checks the audit logs and extracts 1 of each kind of event. This can take a while depending on how large your logs are. The program writes them to a file, audit.log, in the current directory. 

The program aucoverage will tell you if the audit.log file has one of everything or if any record type is known missing based on the compiled table inside ausearch.

The aumerge program can combine logs so that if you have 2 logs with different events and some of the same, it will extract some from the first and add to the second. This is useful when you run gather-logs on different systems and want to see if you found anything new that you don't have in the master test log.

ausearch-test will exercise ausearch. You can optionally pass it a full path to ausearch or a log for testing purposes. If the file is executable, it will use it as the ausearch program. If the file is not executable, it will assume that you are passing a log file to test. You may pass it both a new ausearch and a log file. It otherwise expects a file in the current directory called audit.log to be used for testing purposes and uses ausearch found by $PATH. The default behavior is to stop on the first failing record. If you would like to see other failures, you may pass --continue. If this is done, it aborts the current record since it will be impossible to do any further testing and moves to the next record in the log file.
